# Project overview

Here we go again with another project from the **React** section of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card)!

The aim here was to build a simple memory card game, where the player needs to select each card only **once**.

A live preview is available [here](https://main--react-memory-cards-3f2fac.netlify.app/).

# What I learned

More React tricks, in particular:

- the useEffect hook
- the Context API

# What's next

This project could be revisited in order to fetch images from an external API instead.
